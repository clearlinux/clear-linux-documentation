   Screenshots in this document show VMware Workstation 14 Player for
   Windows. Menus and prompts in the Linux version have minor wording
   differences.

      * On Linux distros: :file:`/home/username/vmware`
      * On Windows: :file:`C:\Users\username\Documents\Virtual Machines`

#. On the :guilabel:`VMware Workstation Player` home screen, select your

   .. note::

      When asked to convert the existing virtual disk to a newer format,
      selecting either option works.

Enable UEFI boot support
************************

|CL| needs UEFI support to boot. To enable it, add the
following line to the end of your VM's :file:`.vmx` file:

.. code-block:: console

   firmware = "efi"

.. note::

   Depending on the OS, you can typically find the VMware VM files under:

   * On Linux distros: :file:`/home/username/vmware`
   * On Windows: :file:`C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\Virtual Machines`

Power on the VM
***************

After configuring the settings above, power on your |CL| virtual machine.

#. On the :guilabel:`VMware Workstation Player` home screen, select your 
   VM. See figure 15.

   .. figure:: figures/vmw-player-preconf/vmw-player-preconf-15.png
