This page explains how to create a new VM and install |CL| on it with the
VMware Workstation Player hypervisor.

Overview
********

`VMware Workstation Player`_ is a type 2 hypervisor. It runs on top of
Windows\* or Linux\* operating systems. With VMware ESXi, you can
create, configure, manage, and run |CL-ATTR| :abbr:`VMs (Virtual Machines)`
on your local system.

VMware offers a type 1 hypervisor called `VMware ESXi`_ designed for the
cloud environment. For information on how to install |CL| as guest OS on
it, see :ref:`vmware-esxi-install-cl`.

.. note::

   The screenshots on this document show the Windows version of the
   VMware Workstation 15 Player. The menus and prompts are similar to those
   in other versions and for the Linux OS save some minor wording differences.

If you prefer to use a pre-configured |CL| VMware image instead,
see our :ref:`vmw-player-preconf` guide.

      Figure 5: VMware Workstation Player - Set disk capacity

   .. note::

      For optimal performance with the |CL| Desktop image, we recommend 32GB
      of drive space. See :ref:`system-requirements` for more details.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Next` button.

#. On the :guilabel:`Ready to Create Virtual Machine` screen, click the
   :guilabel:`Customize Hardware...` button. See Figure 6.

      Figure 7: VMware Workstation Player - Set memory size

   .. note::
      The |CL| installer ISO needs a minimum of 2GB of RAM.
      After completing installation, |CL| can run on as little as
      128MB of RAM. Thus, you can reduce the memory size if needed.
      See :ref:`system-requirements` for more details.

#. Under the :guilabel:`Device` list, select :guilabel:`Processors`. See
   Figure 8.

Enable UEFI boot support
************************

|CL| needs UEFI support to boot. To enable UEFI:

#. Power off the VM. click the :guilabel:`Player` menu. See Figure 9.

      Figure 9: VMware Workstation Player - Power off virtual machine

#. Go to :guilabel:`Power` and select :guilabel:`Shut Down Guest`.

#. Add the following line to the end of your VM's :file:`.vmx` file:

   .. code-block:: console

      firmware = "efi"

   .. note::

      Depending on the OS, you can typically find the VMware VM files under:

      * On Linux distros: :file:`/home/username/vmware`
      * On Windows: :file:`C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\Virtual Machines`

Install |CL| into the new VM
****************************

#. Select the newly-created VM and click the :guilabel:`Play virtual machine`
   button. See Figure 10.

   .. figure:: figures/vmw-player/vmw-player-10.png
      :scale: 100%

      Figure 10: VMware Workstation Player - Power on virtual machine

#. Follow the :ref:`install-on-target-start` guide to complete the
   installation of |CL|.

#. After the installation completes, reboot the VM. This reboot restarts the
   |CL| installer.

Detach the |CL| installer ISO from the VM
*****************************************

#. To enable the mouse pointer so you access VMware Workstation Player's
   menus, press :kbd:`<CTRL>` + :kbd:`<ALT>` on the keyboard.

#. Go to :menuselection:`Removable Devices-->CD/DVD (IDE)-->Disconnect`.

#. Click the :guilabel:`OK` button.

Install open-vm-tools
*********************

Optional: You may want to install the `open-vm-tools` in your virtual
machine. The Open Virtual Machine Tools (open-vm-tools) are the open source
implementation of VMware Tools for Linux\* guest operating systems.

#. Power on your |CL| virtual machine. On the
   :guilabel:`VMware Workstation Player` home screen, select your VM. See Figure 10.

#. Click :guilabel:`Play virtual machine`.

#. In |CL| you can install the bundle, and enable the tools, in your VM.

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo swupd bundle-add os-cloudguest-vmware
      sudo systemctl enable --now open-vm-tools
