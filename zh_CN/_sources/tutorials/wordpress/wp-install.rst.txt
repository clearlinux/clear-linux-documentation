Set up WordPress\* on a LAMP web server
#######################################

This tutorial shows you how to install the WordPress\* components on your |CL|
:abbr:`LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)` server. At the end of
:ref:`web-server-install`, you created a WordPress-ready database using
phpMyAdmin\* and MariaDB\*. Now that the LAMP server is up and running, you
can add the WordPress components needed to host a WordPress website on your system.

Before you begin
****************

This tutorial assumes that you have successfully completed
:ref:`bare-metal-install-desktop` and you have :ref:`web-server-install`.

Create a WordPress server
*************************

WordPress can be installed in a variety of ways. These instructions are
written for users who have followed our instructions for installing phpMyAdmin
when they :ref:`set up a LAMP web server <web-server-install>`. Note that
all steps in this tutorial have been tested using a NUC6i5SYH Intel® NUC.
Visit the `NUC6i5SYH product page`_ for detailed information.

Numerous online articles are available to help you name your website and
acquire the necessary certificates. Those tasks are beyond the scope of this tutorial.

You can take several actions to harden your website from attacks. The security
of your website and the data it contains are complex and ever-evolving tasks.
Prioritize security if you plan to expose your website to the outside world.
This tutorial does not address security measures that you can take to harden
your site but we strongly encourage you to take action.

.. note::

   Throughout this tutorial, we reference your website name as <your_website>.


Download WordPress and manage directories
=========================================

For this tutorial, you will create a WordPress blog that can be accessed at:
\http://<your_website>/blog.

To accomplish this setup, you must add WordPress components to the :file:`/var/www/html/blog`
directory.

Follow these steps:


#. Navigate to the top level of the website’s root directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd /var/www/html

#. Download the latest version of WordPress:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo curl -O https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz

#. Extract all files and directories from the downloaded file:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo tar –xzvf latest.tar.gz

#. Rename the top-level WordPress directory to “blog”:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo mv wordpress blog

#. Remove the downloaded tar file:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo rm latest.tar.gz

Set up WordPress with web-based GUI
===================================

Recall that you created a database and user when you installed phpMyAdmin when you
set up a |CL| based :ref:`web server <web-server-install>`. Next, you must
connect WordPress to the database and install WordPress.

To continue with the setup, go to: \http://<your_website>/blog/wp-admin/install.php.
The WordPress language option screen appears, as shown in figure 1.

#. Select :guilabel:`English` and click :guilabel:`Continue`.

   below.

   * Database name:       WordPress
   * Database username:   wordpressuser

and password. See figure 5.
