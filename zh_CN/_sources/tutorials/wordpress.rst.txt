This tutorial describes how to setup a web server to host a WordPress\* site on a
|CL-ATTR| system. The tutorial is split into two sections:

#. :ref:`web-server-install`

#. :ref:`wp-install`

If you already have a |CL| based :abbr:`LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)` web server,
you can skip ahead to the second section of this tutorial.

.. note::

   This tutorial is for development and testing purposes only. Additional steps
   are required to secure production systems. Those steps are beyond the scope
   of this tutorial.
