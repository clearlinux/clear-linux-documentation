|CL-ATTR| on Microsoft\* Azure\*
################################

This tutorial shows how to install and use the Azure :abbr:`CLI (Command Line
Interface)` on |CL|. The Azure CLI offers the ability to create and
manage resources in MS Azure from the command line.

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1

Description
***********

|CL| is available for you to use in the Microsoft Azure marketplace and
is offered with three different images, also known as a
:abbr:`SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)`.

* |CL| Basic - This SKU consists of a bare-bones system which can be used as a
  starting point for those wanting to explore and build out a system with
  additional software bundles of their choosing.

* |CL| Containers - This SKU comes with the containers-basic software bundle
  already installed.

* |CL| Machine-learning - This SKU comes pre-loaded with popular open source
  tools for developing machine learning applications.

Sign in at the `Azure portal`_ to access these images from the Azure dashboard,
or use the MS Azure CLI 2.0. If you do not already have an account set up with
MS Azure, you can sign up for a `MS Azure free account`_ to access the
|CL| :abbr:`VM (Virtual Machine)` images.

Prerequisites
*************

To use the MS Azure CLI 2.0 on your |CL| system, your system must have the
following packages installed:

* Python 2.7 or later

* libffi

* OpenSSL 1.0.2

You can check to see which versions you have installed on your system by
running the individual commands as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   python --version

.. code-block:: console

   python 2.7.12

.. code-block:: bash

   openssl version

.. code-block:: console

   OpenSSL 1.0.2n 7 Dec 2017

.. code-block:: bash

   ls -l /usr/lib64/libffi*

.. code-block:: console

   lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    15 Jan 12  2017 /usr/lib64/libffi.so.6 -> libffi.so.6.0.4
   -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 38792 Jan 12  2017 /usr/lib64/libffi.so.6.0.4

If you do not have these packages installed on your |CL| system, install the
sysadmin-basic software bundle using the :command:`swupd` command:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo swupd bundle-add sysadmin-basic

.. note::

   These instructions are for installing the MS Azure CLI 2.0 tools on a |CL|
   system. If you are installing the CLI on another platform, follow the
   instructions in the `MS Azure Install Azure CLI tutorial`_ for your
   specific operating system.

Install MS Azure CLI 2.0 on |CL|
********************************

#. To install the MS Azure CLI 2.0 on |CL|, use the :command:`curl` command as
   follows:

   .. code-block:: bash

      curl -L https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCli | bash

   If you get an error message from :command:`curl` related to the -L
   parameter or an error message is generated that includes the text "Object
   Moved", use the full URL instead of the aka.ms redirect address:

   .. code-block:: bash

      curl https://azurecliprod.blob.core.windows.net/install | bash

#. The installation script begins and prompts you several times during
   execution for information.

   .. note::

      The console output from the script displays your username instead of the
      **[user]** variable shown on this tutorial.

   .. code-block:: console

      ===> In what directory would you like to place the install? (leave blank to use '/home/[user]/lib/azure-cli'):

   Press the :kbd:`Enter` key to accept the default or chose another
   directory in which to install the MS Azure CLI 2.0 tools.

   .. code-block:: console

      ===> In what directory would you like to place the 'az' executable? (leave blank to use '/home/[user]/bin'):

   Press the :kbd:`Enter` key to accept the default or chose another
   directory in which to install the :command:`az` executable.

#. The installation downloads and builds all the required tools. When it is
   complete, it prompts you:

   .. code-block:: console

      ===> Modify profile to update your $PATH and enable shell/tab completion now? (Y/n): Y

   Type :kbd:`Y` and press the :kbd:`Enter` key to allow this modification.

   .. code-block:: console

      ===> Enter a path to an rc file to update (leave blank to use '/home/[user]/.bashrc'):

   Press the :kbd:`Enter` key to accept the default or enter the pathname to
   your :file:`.bashrc` file. The installation completes with the final output
   shown below:

   .. code-block:: console

      -- Backed up '/home/[user].bashrc' to '/home/[user]/.bashrc.backup'
      -- Tab completion set up complete.
      -- If tab completion is not activated, verify that '/home/[user]/.bashrc' is sourced by your shell.
      --
      -- ** Run `exec -l $SHELL` to restart your shell. **
      --
      -- Installation successful.
      -- Run the CLI with /home/[user]/bin/az --help

#. When the installation program finishes, you must restart your shell for
   the changes to take effect. When the installation is successful, run the
   following command to restart your shell.

   .. code-block:: bash

      exec -l $SHELL

With the MS Azure CLI 2.0 executable successfully built and installed, run
the :command:`az` command.

.. code-block:: bash

   az

The output from the :command:`az` command is shown below:

.. code-block:: console

Log into your Microsoft Azure account
*************************************

#. With the :command:`az` command properly installed and functional, login to
   your MS Azure account using the :command:`az login` command shown below:

   .. code-block:: bash

      az login

   The output from this command is:

   .. code-block:: console

      To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://aka.ms/devicelogin and enter the code BQ9MG442B to authenticate.

#. Open your browser and enter the page `https://aka.ms/devicelogin` as shown
   in figure 1:

   .. figure:: /_figures/azure/azure-1.png
      :scale: 50 %
      :alt: Microsoft Device Login

      Figure 1: :guilabel:`Microsoft Device Login`

#. Enter the code `BQ9MG442B` to authenticate your device as shown in figure
   2. The code `BQ9MG442B` is a random authentication code generated for each
   session login and will be different each time you log into MS Azure using
   the :command:`az login` command.

   .. figure:: /_figures/azure/azure-2.png
      :scale: 50 %
      :alt: Microsoft Device Login - Azure CLI

      Figure 2: :guilabel:`Microsoft Device Login - Azure CLI`

#. Once you enter the authentication code, the website displays a screen to
   enter your existing Microsoft Azure credentials.

#. Log in with your existing MS Azure account credentials. The
   browser screen shows you have signed into the Microsoft Cross-platform
   Command Line Interface application on your device, as shown in figure 3.
   You can close the page.

The MS Azure CLI 2.0 interface is now active using your existing MS Azure
account credentials.

Create a MS Azure resource group
********************************

To learn more about MS Azure resource groups, visit the
`Azure Resource Manager overview`_ for an overview and detailed description
of resources within MS Azure.

#. To create a new resource group, run the :command:`az group create ...`
   command shown below to create a resource group named `ClearResourceGroup`
   using the `-n` parameter and locate it in the `westus` region using the
   `-l` parameter.

   .. code-block:: bash

      az group create -n ClearResourceGroup -l westus

#. When the command has completed, the output from this command is similar to
   the following:

   .. code-block:: console

      {
        "id": "/subscriptions/{unique-id}/resourceGroups/ClearResourceGroup",
        "location": "westus",
        "managedBy": null,
        "name": "ClearResourceGroup",
        "properties": {
          "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
        },
        "tags": null
      }

Create and log into the |CL| virtual machine
********************************************

For this tutorial, we are using the |CL| Basic SKU for our VM.

#. To locate the available |CL| Basic VM SKU images in the MS Azure
   marketplace, run the :command:`az vm image ...` command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      az vm image list --offer clear-linux --sku basic --all --output table

   This command may take some time to finish. The output lists all available
   |CL| Basic images available in the Microsoft Azure marketplace as shown
   below:

   .. code-block:: console

      Offer           Publisher            Sku               Urn                                                            Version

      clear-linux-os  clear-linux-project  basic             clear-linux-project:clear-linux-os:basic:18080.0.0             18080.0.0
      clear-linux-os  clear-linux-project  basic             clear-linux-project:clear-linux-os:basic:18620.0.0             18620.0.0
      clear-linux-os  clear-linux-project  basic             clear-linux-project:clear-linux-os:basic:18860.0.0             18860.0.0

   .. note::

      The output list shows current offerings. New versions are added to the
      MS Azure marketplace all the time. To reference the latest version of an
      image, you can use the version label `latest` when specifying an image.

#. The information shown in the `Urn` column lists the
   `Publisher:Offer:Sku:Version` for each image available. This is the
   information we want to create the |CL| Basic VM. Since we are creating a
   |CL| Basic VM, highlight the `clear-linux-project:clear-linux-os:basic:`
   string and copy it to your clipboard. Use the label
   `latest` instead of referencing a specific version.

#. Create the new |CL| Basic VM. Run the :command:`az vm create ...`
   command using the URN `:clear-linux-project:clear-linux-os:basic:latest`
   that we copied to the clipboard on the previous step.

   .. code-block:: bash

      az vm create --resource-group ClearResourceGroup --name ClearVM --image clear-linux-project:clear-linux-os:basic:latest --generate-ssh-keys

   .. note::

      If you have already defined your public/private SSH key pair and they
      are stored in your :file:`$HOME/.ssh` directory, you do not need to
      include the *--generate-ssh-keys* option.

   The output from this command will look similar to this output, where
   [user] is your user name:

   .. code-block:: console

      SSH key files '/home/[user]/.ssh/id_rsa' and '/home/[user]/.ssh/id_rsa.pub' have been generated under ~/.ssh to allow SSH access to the VM. If using machines without permanent storage, back up your keys to a safe location.

      running...

      {
        "fqdns": "",
        "id": "/subscriptions/{unique-id}/resourceGroups/ClearResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/ClearVM",
        "location": "westus",
        "macAddress": "00-0D-3A-37-C7-59",
        "powerState": "VM running",
        "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.4",
        "publicIpAddress": "13.91.4.245",
        "resourceGroup": "ClearResourceGroup",
        "zones": ""
      }

   Take note of the public IP address from the output.

#. Login into the new |CL| Basic VM, run the :command:`ssh` command with the
   public IP address obtained from the previous step as shown:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ssh [user]@13.91.4.245

   You may see the following message about the authenticity of the host. If
   this appears, type `yes` to proceed connecting to your new |CL| VM.

   .. code-block:: console

      The authenticity of host '13.91.4.245 (13.91.4.245)' can't be established.
      RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:{unique-number}.
      Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
      Warning: Permanently added '13.91.4.245' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.

      [user]@ClearVM ~ $

   You are now logged into your new |CL| VM as [user], where [user] is your
   user name. To check which software bundles are included with
   this VM image, run the :command:`sudo swupd bundle-list` command inside the
   VM:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo swupd bundle-list

   The output shown should be similar to:

   .. code-block:: console

      swupd-client bundle list 3.14.1

      python-basic
      python3-basic

      sysadmin-basic
      Current OS version: 19600

   When you are finished using your new |CL| VM, type :command:`exit` to close
   the :command:`SSH` terminal and logout.

Stop and deallocate the |CL| VM and resources
*********************************************

When you finish using your new |CL| instance, you must stop the VM and
deallocate the resources in your resource group. If you only stop a VM, the OS
image shuts down but the resources associated with it in your resource group
remain allocated and incurring charges. For instance, if you stop and then
later start the VM using the :command:`az vm start...` without deallocating
the resources, the IP address is retained and you can access the VM using that
same IP address. To release the resources associated with the VM and stop
incurring charges for them, you must deallocate the resources as well.

#. At the command prompt, enter the :command:`az vm stop...` command as
   follows:

   .. code-block:: bash

      az vm stop --resource-group ClearResourceGroup --name ClearVM

   This will stop the VM and then output text similar to:

   .. code-block:: console

      {
        "endTime": "2017-12-13T23:04:02.346676+00:00",
        "error": null,
        "name": "{unique-name}",
        "startTime": "2017-12-13T23:03:59.018536+00:00",
        "status": "Succeeded"
      }

#. Once the VM stops, deallocate the VM resources to stop incurring
   charges for the |CL| instance. Enter the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      az vm deallocate --resource-group ClearResourceGroup --name ClearVM

**Congratulations!** You are up and running with |CL| on MS Azure using the
Azure CLI 2.0 command line tools.
