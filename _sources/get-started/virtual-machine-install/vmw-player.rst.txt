|CL-ATTR| on VMware\* Workstation Player
########################################

This guide explains how to set up the VMware\* Workstation Player 15.5.1
hypervisor and instantiate a VM instance of |CL| by installing it using 
an ISO or using a pre-built image.

Overview
********

`VMware Workstation Player`_ is a type 2 hypervisor. It runs on top of
Windows\* or Linux\* operating systems. With VMware Workstation Player, 
you can create, configure, manage, and run |CL-ATTR| 
:abbr:`VMs (Virtual Machines)` on your local system.

VMware offers a type 1 hypervisor called `VMware ESXi`_ designed for the
cloud environment. For information on how to install |CL| as guest OS on
it, see :ref:`vmware-esxi-install-cl`.

.. note::

   The screenshots in this document show the Windows version of the
   VMware Workstation Player 15.5.1. The menus and prompts are similar to those
   in other versions and for the Linux version, save some minor wording 
   differences.

Install the VMware Workstation Player hypervisor
************************************************

#. Enable Intel速 Virtualization Technology (Intel速 VT) and
   Intel速 Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (Intel速 VT-d) in
   your system's BIOS.

#. `VMware Workstation Player`_ is available for Windows and Linux.
   Download your preferred version.

#. Install VMware Workstation Player by following the instructions
   appropriate for your system's OS:

   * On supported Linux distros:

     a. Ensure your Linux distro is running a GUI desktop.
     #. Start a terminal emulator.
     #. Start the installer by issuing the command below and follow the
        guided steps.

        .. code-block:: console

           sudo sh ./VMware-Player-<version number>.x86_64.bundle

   * On Windows:

     a. Start the installer.
     #. Follow the setup wizard.

For additional help, see the `VMware Workstation Player Documentation`_.

   .. note::

      For optimal performance with the |CL| Desktop image, we recommend 32GB
      of drive space. See :ref:`system-requirements` for more details.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Next` button.

#. On the :guilabel:`Ready to Create Virtual Machine` screen, click the

      Figure 7: VMware Workstation Player - Set memory size

   .. note::

      The |CL| live installer ISO needs a minimum of 1GB of RAM.
      After completing installation, |CL| can run on as little as
      128MB of RAM. Thus, you can reduce the memory size if needed.
      See :ref:`system-requirements` for more details.

#. Under the :guilabel:`Device` list, select :guilabel:`Processors`. See
   Figure 8.

      option

#. Under :guilabel:`Processors` and :guilabel:`Number of processor cores`, 
   enter the desired number of cores. 

#. Under the :guilabel:`Virtualization engine` section,
   check the :guilabel:`Virtualize Intel VT-x/EPT or AMD-V/RVI` box.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Close` button.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Finish` button.

Enable UEFI boot support
************************

|CL| needs UEFI support to boot and work properly. To enable it:

#. Close the ``VMware Workstation Player`` app.

#. Add the following line to the end of your VM's :file:`.vmx` file.

   .. code-block:: console

      firmware = "efi"

   .. note::

      Depending on the OS, you can typically find the VMware VM files under:

        * On Linux distros: :file:`/home/username/vmware`
        * On Windows: :file:`C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\Virtual Machines`
      
Instantiate |CL|

in the **Install |CL| using ISO** tab.  Otherwise, follow the 
**Use |CL| pre-built VMware image** tab to use our pre-built image.
 
.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Install |CL| using ISO 

      #. Navigate to the |CL| `Downloads`_ page and download either the ``Server``
         or ``Desktop`` ISO image.  After the download is complete, you will 
         attach this image.

      #. Start the ``VMware Workstation Player`` app.
