clr_power

:Manual section: 1

SYNOPSIS
--------

``clr_power`` is a utility to adjust power and performance settings in
the operating system. It is configurable and can enforce power and
performance policies.

**clr_power** [**-d**\ \|\ **–debug**]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

``clr_power`` adjusts power and performance in the operating system by
setting runtime kernel and device parameters in the proc(5) filesystem.
``clr_power`` operates with built-in default values. Values can be added
or changed in user-defined `clr-power-tweaks.conf(5) <clr-power-tweaks.conf.5.html>`__ file.

``clr_power`` applies settings and immediately exits after it is
started. It can act as a daemon that enforces settings with the included
systemd files.

The program handles server and desktop-like systems differently and will
set values based on whether a system is a server platform or a desktop
platform. Most systems will be assumed a server, and if it can’t be
determined what type of platform the system is, treated as a server
platform. By default, systems with CPU’s that identify as ``Core(TM)``,
``Celeron`` and ``Pentium`` are treated as desktop systems, and systems
with CPU’s that identify as ``Xeon`` are treated as server systems.

Tunings applied will vary per system. To see what tunings are applied,
run the program with the ``--debug`` option.

OPTIONS
-------

``-d``, ``--debug`` Display debug/verbose output including built-in
values.

``-S``, ``--server`` Treat the system as a server, and apply server
specific tunings.

``-D``, ``--desktop`` Treat the system as a desktop, and apply desktop
specific tunings

FILES
-----

-  *clr-power.service* systemd service unit that executes **clr_power**.

-  *clr-power.timer* systemd timer that periodically executes the
   *clr-power.service* to enforce settings.

-  *clr-power-rfkill.service* systemd service that stops bluetooth
   devices at boot to prevent power drain.

-  */etc/clr-power-tweaks.conf* Optional user-defined configuration file
   to override or att values. See `clr-power-tweaks.conf(5) <clr-power-tweaks.conf.5.html>`__ for more
   information.
