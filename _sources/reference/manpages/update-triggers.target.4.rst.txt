SYNOPSIS
========

``update-triggers.target``

``/usr/lib/systemd/system/update-triggers.target``


DESCRIPTION
===========

Instructs the ``systemd``\(1) system daemon what units needed to be
started as part of the software update process. After the main software
update content is applied to the OS, the `swupd(1) <swupd.1.html>`__ program starts
this *systemd* target.

The main function of this target is to allow optional corrections and
adjustments to be made after installation that can not easily be made
through static file installation methods. This usually applies to things
like cached lists, dynamic configuration files and similar volatile
databases that are regularly altered and may contain user data.

One example is the dynamic loader cache which needs to be updated when
ever there are modifications to the system installed dynamic libraries.

The user is not intended to execute these scripts and plugin units
directly. If however so this is desired, one can execute the following
command to re-execute all the actions:

``systemctl start update-triggers.target``


ENVIRONMENT
===========

This unit is a ``systemd``\(1) target file.
