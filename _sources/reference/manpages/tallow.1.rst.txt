tallow
======

Reduce log clutter due to ssh login attempts.

SYNOPSIS
--------

``/usr/sbin/tallow``

DESCRIPTION
-----------

``tallow`` is a daemon that watches the systemd journal for messages
from the ``sshd`` service. It parses the messages and looks for
attempted random logins such as failed logins to the root account and
failed logins to invalid user accounts, and various other obviously
malicious login attempts that try things as forcing old protocols, or
weak key systems.

If such logins were detected, the offending IP address is stored in a
list. Items from this list are regularly purged, but if the amount of
times that a specific IP address is seen exceeds a threshold, an
ipset(1) entry is inserted in the ``tallow`` or ``tallow6`` ipset, and
further packets from that ip address will be blocked by an
``iptables(1)`` or ``ip6tables(1)`` rule that tallow creates at startup.
Additionally, certain types of login failure will trigger a short term
ban of further packets from the offending IP address immediately.

The system administrator needs to assure that the tallow and tallow6
ipsets are left alone and that the inserted iptables rules are properly
matching on packets.

Care should be taken to assure that legitimate users are not blocked
inadvertently. You may wish to list any valid IP address with the
whitelist option in `tallow.conf(5) <tallow.conf.5.html>`__. Multiple addresses can be
whitelisted.

OPTIONS
-------

The ``tallow`` daemon itself has no runtime configuration. All
configuration is done through the `tallow.conf(5) <tallow.conf.5.html>`__ config file.

SIGNALS
-------

The ``USR1`` signal causes ``tallow`` to print out itâ€™s internal
tracking table of IP addresses. This requires that tallow is compiled
with the ``-DDEBUG=1`` symbol passed to the compiler.

SEE ALSO
--------

`tallow.patterns(5) <tallow.patterns.5.html>`__

BUGS
----

``tallow`` is ``NOT A SECURITY SOLUTION``, nor does it protect against
random password logins. A attacker may still be able to logon to your
systems if you allow password logins.
