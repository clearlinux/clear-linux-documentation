`ucd-data-fetch(1) <ucd-data-fetch.1.html>`__ â€“ Fetch user-data and ssh keys from cloud services

SYNOPSIS
--------

``/usr/bin/ucd-data-fetch <aws|oci|tencent>``

DESCRIPTION
-----------

``ucd-data-fetch`` is a helper agent program that fetches openstack
user-data from the http://169.254.*/ service, as well as the SSH pubkey
provided to the cloud instance. After fetching the two pieces of data,
ucd-data-fetch combines them into a valid ``#cloud-config`` user-data
text block and passes the output to `ucd(1) <ucd.1.html>`__ for
processing/execution.

The user-data file is currently only fetched for aws instances.

OPTIONS
-------

The only parameter supported is the name of the cloud service provider,
and can be ``aws``, ``oci`` or ``tencent``. It is required, and if not
passed as argument 1, will cause the program to terminate with an error
message.

EXIT STATUS
-----------

On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise. The exit
code returned may be the exit code of the subsequent ``ucd`` program
execution.
