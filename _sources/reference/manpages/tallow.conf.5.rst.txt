===========

The tallow configuration file

NAME
----

tallow.conf - Tallow daemon configuration file

SYNOPSIS
--------

``/etc/tallow.conf``

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This file is read on startup by the `tallow(1) <tallow.1.html>`__ daemon, and can be used to
provide options to the tallow daemon. If not present, tallow will
operate with built-in defaults.

OPTIONS
-------

``fwcmd_path``\ =\ ``<string>`` Specifies the location of the ipset(1)
firewall-cmd(1) programs. By default, tallow will look in “/usr/sbin”
for them.

``ipt_path``\ =\ ``<string>`` Specifies the location of the ipset(1)
program and iptables(1) or ip6tables(1) programs. By default, tallow
will look in “/usr/sbin” for them.

``expires``\ =\ ``<int>`` The number of seconds that IP addresses are
blocked for. Note that due to the implementation, IP addresses may be
blocked for much longer than this period. If IP addresses are seen, but
not blocked within this period, they are also removed from the watch
list. Defaults to 3600s.

``whitelist``\ =\ ``<ip address|pattern>`` Specify an IP address or
``pattern`` that should never be blocked. Multiple IP addresses can be
included by repeating the ``whitelist`` option several times. By
default, 127.0.0.1, 192.168., and 10. are whitelisted. If you create a
manual whitelist, you must include these entries if you want to continue
them to be whitelisted as well, otherwise they will be omitted from the
whitelist.

If the last character of the listed ip adress is a ``.`` or a ``:``,
then the matching is only performed on the leftmost characters of an IP
address against the whitelist entry. For instance, if you whitelist
``10.`` then all IP addresses in the ``10/8`` subnet mask will match
this whitelist entry and never be blocked.

``ipv6``\ =\ ``<0|1>`` Enable or disable ipv6 (ip6tables) support. Ipv6
is disabled automatically on systems that do not appear to have ipv6
support and enabled when ipv6 is present. Use this option to explicitly
disable ipv6 support if your system does not have ipv6 or is missing
ip6tables. Even with ipv6 disabled, tallow will track and log ipv6
addresses.

``nocreate``\ =\ ``<0|1>`` Disable the creation of firewall rules and
ipset sets. By default, tallow will create new firewall-cmd(1) or
iptables(1) and ip6tables(1) rules when needed automatically. If set to
``1``, `tallow(1) <tallow.1.html>`__ will not create any new firewall DROP rules or
ipset sets that are needed work. You should create them manually before
tallow starts up and remove them afterwards using the sets of commands
below.

Use the following commands if you’re using iptables(1):

::

   ipset create tallow hash:ip family inet timeout 3600
   iptables -t filter -I INPUT 1 -m set --match-set tallow src -j DROP

   ipset create tallow6 hash:ip family inet6 timeout 3600
   ip6tables -t filter -I INPUT 1 -m set --match-set tallow6 src -j DROP

Use the following commands if you’re using firewalld(1):

::

     firewall-cmd --permanent --new-ipset=tallow --type=hash:ip --family=inet --option=timeout=3600
     firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 1 -m set --match-set tallow src -j DROP

     firewall-cmd --permanent --new-ipset=tallow6 --type=hash:ip --family=inet6 --option=timeout=3600
     firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv6 filter INPUT 1 -m set --match-set tallow6 src -j DROP
