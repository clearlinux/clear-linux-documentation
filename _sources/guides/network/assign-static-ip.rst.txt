Assign a static IP address
##########################


This guide explains how to assign a static IP address. This may be helpful in
scenarios such as a network with no DHCP server.

Identify which program is managing the interface
************************************************

New installations of |CL-ATTR| use NetworkManager as the default network
interface manager for all network connections.

.. note:: 

   * The cloud |CL| images continue to use `systemd-networkd` to manage
     network connections.

   * In earlier |CL| versions, `systemd-network` was used to manage Ethernet
     interfaces and NetworkManager was used for wireless interfaces.


Before defining a configuration for assigning a static IP address, verify
which program is managing the network interface.

#. Check the output of :command:`nmcli device` to see if NetworkManager is
   managing the device.

   .. code-block:: bash

      nmcli device status

   If the STATE column for the device shows *connected* or *disconnected*, the
   network configuration is being managed by NetworkManager, then use the
   instructions for :ref:`using NetworkManager <nm-static-ip>`.

   If the STATE column for the device shows *unmanaged*, then check if the
   device is being managed by systemd-networkd.


#. Check the output of :command:`networkctl list` to see if
   `systemd-networkd` is managing the device.

   .. code-block:: bash

      networkctl list 

   If the SETUP column for the device shows *configured*, the network
   configuration is being managed by `systemd-networkd`, then use the
   instructions for :ref:`using systemd-networkd <networkd-static-ip>`.


.. _nm-static-ip:

Using NetworkManager
********************

Network connections managed by NetworkManager are stored as files with the
:file:`.nmconnection` file extension in the
:file:`/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/` directory.

A few tools exists to aid to manipulate network connections managed by
NetworkManager:

* nmcli - a command-line tool 

* nmtui - a text user interface that provides a pseudo graphical menu in the
  terminal

* nm-connection-editor - a graphical user interface

The method below uses the command line tool nmcli to modify network
connection. 


#. Identify the existing connection name:

   .. code:: bash

      nmcli connection show

   Sample output:

   .. code:: bash

      NAME                UUID                                  TYPE            DEVICE 
      Wired connection 1  00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000  802-3-etherneten01

   If a connection does not exist, create it with the
   :command:`nmcli connection add` command.


#. Modify the connection to use a static IP address. Replace the variables in
   brackets with the appropriate values. Replace *[CONNECTION_NAME]* with the
   NAME from the command above.

   .. code::

      sudo nmcli connection modify "[CONNECTION_NAME]" \
      ipv4.method "manual" \
      ipv4.addresses "[IP_ADDRESS]/[CIDR_NETMASK]" \
      ipv4.gateway "[GATEWAY_IP_ADDRESS]" \
      ipv4.dns "[PRIMARY_DNS_IP],[SECONDARY_DNS_IP]"


   See the `nmcli developer page <https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/stable/nmcli.html>`_ for more
   configuration options. For advanced configurations, the
   :file:`/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/*.nmconnection`. can be edited
   directly.


#. Restart the NetworkManager server to reload the DNS servers:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager


#. Verify your static IP address details have been set:

   .. code-block:: bash

      nmcli



.. _networkd-static-ip:

Using systemd-networkd
**********************

Network connections managed by systemd-networkd are stored as files with the
:file:`.network` file extension the :file:`/etc/systemd/network/` directory.

Files to manipulate network connections managed by systemd-networkd must be
created manually. 

#. Create the :file:`/etc/systemd/network` directory if it does not already exist:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/network

#. Create a :file:`.network` file and add the following content. Replace the
   variables in brackets with the appropriate values. Replace *[INTERFACE_NAME]*
   with LINK from the output of the :command:`networkctl list` command that was
   run previously.

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo $EDITOR /etc/systemd/network/70-static.network

      [Match]
      Name=[INTERFACE_NAME]

      [Network]
      Address=[IP_ADDRESS]/[CIDR_NETMASK]
      Gateway=[GATEWAY_IP_ADDRESS]
      DNS=[PRIMARY_DNS_IP]
      DNS=[SECONDARY_DNS_IP]

   See the `systemd-network man page
   <https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.network.html>`_
   for more configuration options.

#. Restart the `systemd-networkd` service:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd


#. Verify your static IP address details have been set:

   .. code-block:: bash

      networkctl status
