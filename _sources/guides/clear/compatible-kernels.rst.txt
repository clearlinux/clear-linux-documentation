Kernels
#######

The |CL-ATTR| provides the following Linux kernels with a respective bundle.
This document describes the specific use cases these `bundles`_ serve
and provides links to their source code.

Bare metal only
***************

Kernel native
    The *kernel-native* bundle focuses on the bare metal platforms. It is
    optimized for fast booting and performs best on the Intel速 Architecture Processors
    described on the :ref:`supported hardware list<system-requirements>`. The
    optimization patches are found in our `Linux`_ GitHub\* repo.

.. _vm-kernels:

Also compatible with VMs
************************

Kernel LTS
    The *kernel-lts* bundle focuses on the bare metal platforms but uses the
    latest :abbr:`LTS (Long Term Support)` Linux kernel. It is optimized for
    fast booting and performs best on the Intel速 Architecture Processors described
    on the :ref:`supported hardware list<system-requirements>`. Additionally, this
    kernel includes the VirtualBox\* kernel modules, see our
    :ref:`instructions on using Virtualbox<virtualbox-cl-installer>` for more
    information. The optimization patches are found in our `Linux-LTS`_ GitHub
    repo.

VM only
*******

Kernel KVM
    The *kernel-kvm* bundle focuses on the Linux
    :abbr:`KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)`. It is optimized for fast
    booting and performs best on Virtual Machines running on the Intel速 Architecture
    Processors described on the
    :ref:`supported hardware list<system-requirements>`. Use this kernel when
    running |CL| as the guest OS on top of *qemu/kvm*. Use this kernel with
    **cloud orchestrators** using *qemu/kvm* internally as their **hypervisor**
    . This kernel can be used as a standalone |CL| VM, see our
    :ref:`instructions on using KVM<kvm>` for more information. The
    optimization patches are found in our `Linux-KVM`_ GitHub repo.

Kernel Hyper-V\*
    The *kernel-hyperv* bundle focuses on running Linux on Microsoft\*
    Hyper-V. It is optimized for fast booting and performs best on Virtual
    Machines running on the Intel速 Architecture Processors described on the
    :ref:`supported hardware list<system-requirements>`.
    Use this kernel when running |CL| as the guest OS of **Cloud Instances** in
    projects such as Microsoft `Azure`_\*. This kernel can be used in a
    standalone |CL| VM, see our :ref:`instructions on using Hyper-V<hyper-v>`
    for more information. The optimization patches are found in our
    `Linux-HyperV`_ GitHub repo.
