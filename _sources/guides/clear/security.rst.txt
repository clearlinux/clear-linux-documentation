OS Security
###########

|CL-ATTR| aims to make systemic and layered security-conscious decisions
that are both performant and practical. This security philosophy is rooted
within the project's codebase and operating culture.

Security in updates
*******************

The |CL| team believes in the benefits of software security through open
sourcing, incremental updates, and rapidly resolving known security advisories.

The latest Linux\* codebase
===========================

|CL| uses the newest version of the Linux kernel which allows the operating
system to leverage the latest features from the upstream Linux kernel,
including security fixes.

Automated effective updating
============================

|CL| is incrementally updated multiple times per day.

This `rolling release`_ model allows |CL| to consume the latest security fixes
of software packages as soon as they become available. There is no waiting for
major or minor releases on |CL|.

An update is not effective if it is just simply downloaded onto a system.
It needs to be obtained *AND* ensured that the new patched copy is being
used; not an older copy loaded into memory. |CL| will let you know when a
service needs to be rebooted or do it for your automatically after
a software update, if desired.

In |CL| updates are delivered automatically, efficiently, and effectively. For
more information about software updates in |CL|, refer to the :ref:`swupd-guide`
guide.

Automated CVE scanning and remediation
======================================

The sheer number of software packages and security vulnerabilities is growing
exponentially. Repositories of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)
and their fixes, if known, are published by :abbr:`NIST` in a
National Vulnerability Database \ |NVD|\  and at \ |MITRE|\  .

|CL| employs a proactive and measured approach to addressing known
and fixable :abbr:`CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)`.
Packages are automatically scanned against CVEs daily, and security
patches are deployed as soon as they are available.

These combined practices minimize the amount of time |CL| systems are exposed to unnecessary security risk.

Security in software
*********************

Minimized attack surface
========================

|CL| removes legacy, unneeded, or redundant standards and components as much as
possible to enable the use of best known security standards. Below are some
examples:

* `RC4`, `SSLv3`, `3DES`, and `SHA-1` ciphers which have had known
  vulnerabilities, have been explicitly disabled within many |CL| packages to
  avoid their accidental usage.

* Services and subsystems which expose sensitive system information
  have been removed such as the `finger` and `tcpwrappers`.

* `SFTP` has been disabled by default due to security considerations.

Verified trust
==============

|CL| encourages the use of secure practices such as encryption
and digital signature verification throughout the system and discourages blind
trust. Below are some examples:

* All update operations from swupd are transparently encrypted and checked
  against the |CL| maintainers' public key for authenticity.
  More information about swupd security can be found in the
  `Security for software update in Clear Linux* OS`_ blog post.

* Before being built, packages available from |CL| verify checksums and
  signatures provided by third party project codebases and maintainers.

* |CL| features a unified certificate store, `clrtrust`_ which comes
  ready to work with well-known Certificate Authorities out of the box.
  clrtrust also offers an easy to use command line interface for managing
  system-wide chains of trust, instead of ignoring foreign certificates.

Compiled with secure options
============================

While |CL| packages are optimized for performance on IntelÂ® architecture,
security conscious kernel and compiler options are sensibly taken advantage of.
Below are some examples:

* Kernels shipped with |CL| are signed and disallow the usage of
  custom kernel modules to maintain verifiable system integrity.

* `Address space layout randomization (ASLR)`_ and
  `Kernel address space layout randomization (KASLR)`_  are kernel features
  which defend against certain memory based attacks.
  More information about PIE executables can be found in the
  `Recent GNU* C library improvements`_ blog post.

Security in system design
*************************

Simple, yet effective, techniques are used throughout the |CL| system design to
defend against common attack vectors and enable good security hygiene. Below are
some examples:

* Full disk encryption using :abbr:`LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup)` is available
  during installation. Refer to `cryptsetup`_ for additional information about
  LUKS.

* |CL| uses the PAM cracklib module to harden user login and password
  security resulting in:

  - No default username or root password set out of the box with
    |CL|, you will be asked to set your own password immediately.

  - Simple password schemes, which are known to be easily compromised,
    cannot be set in |CL|.

  - A password blacklist, to avoid system passwords being set to
    passwords which have been compromised in the past.

* `Tallow`_, a lightweight service which monitors and blocks suspicious SSH
  login patterns, is installed with the :command:`openssh-server` bundle.
