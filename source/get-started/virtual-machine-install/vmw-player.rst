   :depth: 1

Overview
********

`VMware Workstation Player`_ is a type 2 hypervisor. It runs on top of
Windows\* or Linux\* operating systems. With VMware Workstation Player, 
you can create, configure, manage, and run |CL-ATTR| 
:abbr:`VMs (Virtual Machines)` on your local system.

VMware offers a type 1 hypervisor called `VMware ESXi`_ designed for the
cloud environment. For information on how to install |CL| as guest OS on
it, see :ref:`vmware-esxi-install-cl`.

.. note::

   The screenshots on this document show the Windows version of the
   VMware Workstation 15 Player. The menus and prompts are similar to those
   in other versions and for the Linux OS save some minor wording differences.

Install the VMware Workstation Player hypervisor
************************************************

#. Enable :abbr:`Intel® VT (Intel® Virtualization Technology)` and
   :abbr:`Intel® VT-d (Intel® Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O)` in
   your system's BIOS.

#. `VMware Workstation Player`_ is available for Windows and Linux.
   Download your preferred version.

   .. note::

      By default, selecting download means you receive the latest version
      of this application. Commands may differ based on the version.

   appropriate for your system's OS:

   * On supported Linux distros:

     #. Enable a GUI desktop.
     #. Start a terminal emulator.
     #. Start the installer by issuing the command below and follow the
        guided steps.

      Figure 7: VMware Workstation Player - Set memory size

   .. note::
      The |CL| installer ISO needs a minimum of 2GB of RAM.
      After completing installation, |CL| can run on as little as
      128MB of RAM. Thus, you can reduce the memory size if needed.
      See :ref:`system-requirements` for more details.

#. Under the :guilabel:`Device` list, select :guilabel:`Processors`. See
   Figure 8.

#. Power on your |CL| virtual machine. On the 
:guilabel:`VMware Workstation Player` home screen, select your VM. 
See Figure 10.

#. Click :guilabel:`Play virtual machine`.

#. In |CL| you can install the bundle, and enable the tools, in your VM.

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo swupd bundle-add os-cloudguest-vmware
      sudo systemctl enable --now open-vm-tools
