Recommended minimum system requirements
#######################################

Clear Linux\* OS for Intel® Architecture can run on very minimal hardware.
For example, it can run on a system with a single core CPU, 128MB of memory,
and 600MB of disk space.

Different use cases and applications will require different configurations.
For general |CL| use, in addition to a supported processor, the recommended
minimum requirements include:

*  Processors:

   Clear Linux\* OS for Intel® Architecture can run on any Intel® 64bit
   processors which support UEFI\* and SSE\* v4.1 streaming SIMD\*
   instructions.

   The following processor families have been verified to run |CL|:

   * 2nd Generation, or later, Intel® Core™ processor family.
   * Intel® Xeon® Processor E3
   * Intel® Xeon® Processor E5
   * Intel® Xeon® Processor E7
   * Intel® Atom™ processor C2000 product family for servers -- Q3 2013
     version or later.
   * Intel® Atom™ processor E3800 series -- Q4 2013 version or later.

   To help determine if a processor is supported, you can run a
   :ref:`compatibility check<compatibility-check>` or go to
   http://ark.intel.com and check for these features:

   * Instruction Set = 64-bit
   * Instruction Set Extensions = SSE 4.1

*  Memory: 4GB RAM

*  Hard Disk: 20GB HDD

*  Network: Active Internet connection

*  Graphics: Intel HD Graphics (required if running a GUI desktop)
