Overview
********

The |CLOSIA| uses Sphinx and RestructuredText as authoring tools for its
documentation. This section contains the preferred methods for using the
:abbr:`ReST (RestructuredText)` markup on your documents. Please refer to the
`Sphinx documentation`_ for the complete list of available markup and use
as much markup as possible.

.. _Sphinx documentation: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html

Remember: **Changing incorrect markup is easier than adding markup from
scratch.**

We provide templates, examples, and use scenarios to help you write and edit
documents easily. Use only the templates provided to ensure your content is
consistent with the rest of the documentation.

Contributions with incorrect use of markup will not be merged until the
markup is fixed. If you have any questions regarding markup, send an email to
our mailing list at dev@lists.clearlinux.org and we will gladly help.

To allow for easy copy and paste of the provided templates,
they are provided using either the "\`\`" parenthesis, for single line
templates, or the code-block directive, for multi-lined templates.

Every use case is explained, examples provided and, lastly,
templates supplied.
