Headings
########

Descriptive and brief headings are crucial to the quality of the
documentation. Sphinx uses the headings within the
:abbr:`ReST (RestructuredText)` files to generate the navigation of the HTML
output and the outlines of the PDF files. The |CL-ATTR| publishes the
documentation as HTML making consistent heading levels extremely important.

In addition to the title of the file, only three levels of headings are
accepted. The following example shows all accepted levels of headings:

.. code-block:: rst

   Title
   #####

   Level 1 sections
   ****************

   Level 2 sections
   ================

   Level 3 sections
   ----------------

Headings must be written in sentence case. Learn more about the correct
capitalization in our :ref:`grammar guide<grammar>`.
