mixer
#####

**mixer** is the tool used by the |CL-ATTR| team to generate official update
content and releases. The update content generated by mixer is then consumed
by swupd on a downstream client. The same mixer tool is available as part of
|CL| to create your own customized update content and releases.

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1

Description
***********

mixer uses the following sources as inputs to generate update content:

* Upstream |CL| bundles with their corresponding RPM packages
* Locally-defined bundles with their corresponding local RPM packages
* Locally-defined bundles with upstream RPM packages

Using the mixer tool, you select which set of content from these sources
will be part of your update. You can select content from each of these sources to make a unique combination of functionality for your custom update content, known as a **mix**.

The update content that mixer generates consists of various pieces of OS
content, update metadata, as well as a complete image. The OS content
includes all files in an update, as well as zero- and delta-packs for improved update performance. The update metadata, stored as manifests, describes all of the bundle information for the update. Update content produced by mixer is then published to a web server and consumed by clients via :command:`swupd`. Refer to :ref:`swupd <swupd-guide>` for additional information regarding updates and update content.

How it works

Prerequisites
=============

* :command:`mixer` bundle

  Add the mixer tool by installing the :command:`mixer` bundle. Refer to
  :ref:`swupd-guide` for more information on installing bundles.

* Docker\* container

  mixer by default runs all build commands in a Docker container to ensure
  the correct tool versions are used. This also allows custom mixes to
  automatically perform downstream format bumps when the upstream releases a
  format bump. See `Format version`_ for additional information regarding
  format bumps.

  Refer to `Configure and enable Docker`_ for instruction.

* Docker proxy (optional)

  If you use a proxy server, you must set your proxy environment variables and
  create a proxy configuration file for the Docker daemon and container.

  Consult your IT department for the correct values if you are behind a
  corporate proxy.

  Refer to `Configure Docker proxy info`_ for instruction.

* Location to host the update content and images

  In order for :command:`swupd` to make use of your mix, the update content for your mix must be hosted on a web server. Your mix will be configured with an update location URL, which :command:`swupd` will use to pull down updates.

  Refer to `Set up a nginx web server for mixer`_ for an simple example of
  setting up an update location.

Mix setup
==========

Follow these steps to create and initialize the mixer workspace. Complete
the setup before you create a mix.

#. Create workspace.

   The mixer tool uses a simple workspace to contain all input and output in a
   basic directory structure. The workspace is simply an empty folder from
   which you execute the mixer commands. Each mix uses its own separate
   workspace.

#. Initialize the workspace and mix.

   Before you create a mix, you must explicitly initialize the mixer workspace.
   During initialization, the mixer workspace is configured and the base for
   your mix is defined. By default, your mix is based on the latest
   upstream version and starts with the minimum set of bundles. Your first custom
   mix version number starts at 10. Alternatively, you can select other
   versions or bundle sets from which to start.

   Initialization creates the directory structure within the workspace and adds
   the :file:`builder.conf` file, which is used to configure the mixer tool.

   View the `mixer.init man page`_ for more information on mixer
   initialization.

   View the list of suitable `releases`_ from which to mix.

#. Edit builder.conf.

   :file:`builder.conf` tells the mixer tool how to configure the mix. For
   example, it allows you to configure where mixer output is located and where swupd update content will be located.

   At minimum, set the URL of your update server so your custom OS knows where to get update content.

   Refer to the `builder.conf`_ section for more information.

Create a mix
============

A mix is created with the following steps:

#. Add custom RPMs and set up local repo (optional).

   If you are adding custom RPMs to your mix, you must add the RPMs to
   your mix workspace and set up a corresponding local repository.

   Go to the :ref:`autospec<autospec>` guide to learn to build RPMs from
   scratch. If the RPMs are not built on |CL|, make sure your
   configuration and toolchain builds them correctly for |CL|. Otherwise there
   is no guarantee they will be compatible.

   Refer to the :ref:`autospec` guide for more information on using autospec to
   build RPMs.

#. Update and build bundles.

   Add, edit, or remove bundles that will be part of your content and build
   them. mixer automatically updates the :file:`mixbundles` file when you
   update the bundles in your mix.

   View the `mixer.bundle man page`_ for more information on configuring bundles
   in a mix.

   View the `mixer.build man page`_ for more information on building bundles.

   View the `Bundles`_ section for more information on how mixer manages
   bundles.

#. Create the update content.

   mixer creates update content with this step. Zero-packs are created
   automatically, and delta-packs can be optionally created at the same time
   (for all builds after version 0).

   A zero-pack is the full set of content needed to go from mix version 0
   (nothing) to the mix version for which you just built content.

   A delta-pack provides the content *delta* between a `PAST_VERSION` to a
   `MIX_VERSION` that allows the transition from one mix version to another.

   View :ref:`swupd-guide`  for more information on update content.

#. Create image.

   mixer creates a bootable image from your updated content using
   the :ref:`ister` tool. In this step you can specify which bundles you want
   *preinstalled* in the image. Users can later install other bundles available
   in your mix.

#. Make update available.

   Deploy update content and images to your update server.

   View the `Example 5: Deploy updates to target`_ for a simple deployment
   scenario.

Maintain or modify mix
======================

Update or modify your content to a new version by following the steps to
create a mix. Increment the mix version number for the next mix.

Examples
********

The following examples are designed to work together and in order. The examples
use:

* A stock installation of |CL|.
* A web server that comes with |CL| to host the content updates.
* A simple VM that updates against the locally produced content created in
  Example 2.

Complete all `Prerequisites`_ before using these examples.

Example 1: Mix set up
=====================

This example shows the basic steps for the first-time setup of
mixer for a new mix.

#. Create a directory to use as a workspace for mixer:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mkdir ~/mixer

#. In your mixer workspace, generate an initial mix based on the latest
   upstream |CL| version, with minimum bundles. In the initialization
   output, be aware that your initial mix version is set to 10 and that the
   minimum bundles have been added.

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd ~/mixer
      mixer init

   .. note::

      If you want to add all upstream bundles in your mix,
      initialize your mix as shown below.

   .. code-block:: bash

      mixer init --all-upstream

#. Look up your IP address:

   .. code-block:: bash

      networkctl status

#. Copy the IP “Address”, from above, for the next step.

   .. note::

      In this example, we put `mixer` and `nginx` on the same system. In a production environment, they would likely reside on different systems.

#. Edit :file:`builder.conf`.  Paste the IP address from the previous step
   as the value after \http:// for CONTENTURL and VERSIONURL. For example:

   .. code-block:: console

      CONTENTURL="http://192.168.25.52"
      VERSIONURL="http://192.168.25.52"

#. `Set up a nginx web server for mixer`_.


Example 2: Create a simple mix
==============================

This example shows how to create a simple custom mix using upstream content.
We'll create an image for a QEMU virtual machine that we can use later to
test our mix.

We can use the default bundles that were added during initialization, but
these include the :command:`native-kernel` bundle that is intended to be
used on a bare metal system instead of a VM. So we will modify the default
bundle set to get a smaller kernel image, which will also be faster to load.

The only bundles available to :command:`swupd` for a given release are those
that were added to the mix during build time. A mix doesn’t automatically
inherit upstream bundles.

#. Assure that you have run `mixer init`, shown in Example 1.

#. Update bundles in mix:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mixer bundle remove kernel-native
      mixer bundle add kernel-kvm

   .. note::
      The mixer bundle commands operate on the bundle description files but not on the bundle contents. To remove bundle contents and their tracking completely, follow `Example 6: Remove a bundle from client system`_, Advanced.

#. In this case, we will add the `editors` bundle from upstream, but we will
   remove the :command:`joe` editor.

   .. code-block:: bash

      mixer bundle add editors
      mixer bundle edit editors

#. Use an editor and manually remove `joe` from the bundle definition.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $EDITOR ./local-bundles/editors

#. List the bundles in the mix again to confirm removal of :command:`joe`.

   .. code-block:: bash

      mixer bundle list  --tree

#. Build bundles:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo mixer build bundles

#. First, browse to web server from Example 1. The web page appears yet
   has no update content. Build the update content:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo mixer build update

   After that is completed, on your web server, you can see the update
   content for mix version 10.

Example 3: Create an update for your mix
========================================

Next, let’s create a new version of the mix. We’ll add a new bundle.

#. Create a new version of your mix, for the live image to
   update to. Increment your mix version by 10:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mixer versions update

#. Add the upstream :command:`curl` bundle to version 20 of the mix:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mixer bundle add curl

#. Build your next mix version that incorporates the new bundle.

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo mixer build bundles
      sudo mixer build update

#. Optionally, you can build delta-packs, which help reduce client update
   time:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo mixer build delta-packs --from 10 --to 20

Refresh your web server to see the update content for mix version 20.

You can also look in ~/mixer/update/www/<mix version> to see the update
content in your workspace.


Example 4: Build an image
=========================

This example shows how to build a bootable image containing the
:command:`kernel-kvm`, :command:`os-core`, and the :command:`os-core-update`
bundles from Example 2. Underneath, mixer uses `ister`_ to generate the
image.

#. Change directory into your mix.

#. Configure image.

   Edit the ister configuration file for your image to include all of the bundles you want pre-installed in the image. If this is the first time creating an image, first get a copy of the
   :file:`release-image-config.json` template file:

   .. code-block:: bash

      curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bryteise/ister/master/release-image-config.json

   For this example, make the following revisions
   :file:`release-image-config.json`:

   * Set root partition size to "5G"
   * Replace the "kernel-native" bundle with "kernel-kvm"
   * Set the version to 10 (as an integer)

   .. note::
      When creating an image, select a subset of the bundles that are part of your mix. All the bundles that are *not* part of this subset are available for consumers of that image to install afterwards via swupd.

   .. code-block:: bash
      :linenos:
      :emphasize-lines: 5,11-12

      {
       "DestinationType" : "virtual",
        "PartitionLayout" : [ { "disk" : "release.img", "partition" : 1, "size" : "32M", "type" : "EFI" },
                                  { "disk" : "release.img", "partition" : 2, "size" : "16M", "type" : "swap" },
                                  { "disk" : "release.img", "partition" : 3, "size" : "5G", "type" : "linux" } ],
        "FilesystemTypes" : [   { "disk" : "release.img", "partition" : 1, "type" : "vfat" },
                                  { "disk" : "release.img", "partition" : 2, "type" : "swap" },
                                  { "disk" : "release.img", "partition" : 3, "type" : "ext4" } ],
        "PartitionMountPoints" : [ { "disk" : "release.img", "partition" : 1, "mount" : "/boot" },
                                       { "disk" : "release.img", "partition" : 3, "mount" : "/" } ],
        "Version": 10,
        "Bundles": ["kernel-kvm", "os-core", "os-core-update"]
       }

#. Build the image.

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo mixer build image

   The output from this step will be :file:`release.img`, which is a live
   image.

Example 5: Deploy updates to target
===================================

The image created in Example 4 is directly bootable in QEMU. In this example,
we'll boot the image and verify it. Then we'll update the image from
mix version 10 to mix version 20.

#. Set up the QEMU environment.

   Install the :command:`kvm-host` bundle to your |CL|:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo swupd bundle-add kvm-host

#. Get the virtual EFI firmware, download the image launch script, and make
   it executable:

   .. code-block:: bash

      curl -O https://download.clearlinux.org/image/OVMF.fd
      curl -O https://download.clearlinux.org/image/start_qemu.sh
      chmod +x start_qemu.sh

#. Start your VM image (created in Example 4):

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo ./start_qemu.sh release.img

#. Log in as root and set a password.

#. To avoid adding a flag each time, enter:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mkdir -p /etc/swupd
      cat > /etc/swupd/config << EOF
      [GLOBAL]
      allow_insecure_http=true
      EOF

   .. note:

      By default, the swupd client is designed to communicate with an
      *\https* server. For development purposes, the swupd client can talk to
      an *\http* server if you add the flag :command:`--allow-insecure-http`.

#. Try out your mix.

   Take a look at the default bundles installed in your mix:

   .. code-block:: bash

      swupd info
      swupd bundle-list

#. List available bundles on your update server.


   .. code-block:: bash

      swupd bundle-list -a

#. Now we will add the :command:`editors` bundle that we modified.

   .. code-block:: bash

      swupd bundle-add editors

#. Try to start the :command:`joe` editor.

   .. code-block:: bash

      joe

   It should not appear. We removed it from the original
   :command:`editors` bundle.

#. Next we will update from version 10 to 20 to capture the newly
   available bundles.

   .. code-block:: bash

      swupd check-update
      swupd update
      swupd bundle-list -a

#. Now your mix should be at version 20 and curl is available. Try using
   curl. This will fail because curl is not yet installed:

   .. code-block:: console

      curl: command not found
      To install curl use: swupd bundle-add curl

#. Add the new bundle from your update server to your VM. Retry curl.
   It works!

   .. code-block:: bash

      swupd bundle-add curl
      curl -O https://download.clearlinux.org/image/start_qemu.sh

#. Shutdown your VM:

   .. code-block:: bash

      poweroff

Example 6: Remove a bundle from client system
=============================================

Removing a bundle in a future release requires more steps than deleting the
bundle description file, as shown in Example 2. After a bundle is built in
the mix, you must assure all of the files that are part of the bundle are
removed from the client where that bundle is installed. To do this, create a
version of this bundle in which all of its content is marked for deletion.

In the following example, we show how to remove the contents of the `editors`
bundle that we added to our mix in Example 2.

#. First update your mix version. This will set the mix to the next version.

   .. code-block:: bash

      mixer versions update

   .. note::
      Run this command every time that you want to build a new version.

#. Navigate to local-bundles:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd local-bundles

#. Open the `editors` bundle with an editor and delete
   **all lines** that follow after the `[MAINTAINERS]` line.

#. Afterward, it should look like this:

   .. code-block:: console

      # [TITLE]: editors
      # [DESCRIPTION]: Run popular terminal text editors.
      # [STATUS]: Active
      # [CAPABILITIES]:
      # [TAGS]: Tools and Utilities, Editor
      # [MAINTAINER]: Developer <developer@intel.com>

#. Save and exit.

#. Next, run a build to capture recently edited bundles and update your mix.

   .. code-block:: bash

     sudo mixer build all

   .. note::
      :command:`mixer build all` runs both :command:`mixer build bundles` and :command:`mixer build update` in one step.

At this point the new mix, version 30, is complete. All the content of the
editors bundles is marked as deleted. If any clients of this mix upgraded to
mix build version 30, the content of the editors bundle would be removed.
Note that the bundle still exists and is being tracked by :command:`swupd`,
but it contains no files.

Example 7: Execute a format bump
================================

As a maintainer of your mix, you must execute a format bump if you wish to:

* Track upstream’s format bump on your downstream derivative
* Delete any custom bundles that were added

Follow the appropriate use case below depending on your needs.

Basic
-----

If you maintain your own downstream derivative and you want to track
upstream, you need to do a format bump when one occurs on upstream. This
method helps you track the latest changes on upstream; however, it does not
change any local content that was added or deleted. For example, if you
deprecated bundles, this method will **not remove the bundle tracking**.
Refer to `Advanced`_ for help on managing your local mix and removing bundle
tracking.

In this example, we show a mix version that was initialized to upstream
version 29740 (format 27). You need to update your mix to upstream version
30700 (format 28). To do so, you will go through a format bump.

#. Change to your mix location and verify the current version of the mix and
   its format.

   .. code-block:: bash

      mixer versions

#. Update to upstream version, which has a newer format.

   .. code-block:: bash

      mixer versions update --upstream-version 30700

   The output will look like this:

   .. code-block:: console

      Old mix:      10
      Old upstream: 29740 (format: 27)

      New mix:      20
      New upstream: 30700 (format: 28)
      [...]

   Read the output carefully:

   * The Old mix shows the current version (10) of  your mix.

   * The Old upstream shows the version and format (27) on which it’s based.

   * The New mix shows the new version (20) of your mix.

   * The New upstream shows the version and format (28) on which it’s based.

#. Given that the format in the output differs, you need to run a
   format bump:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo mixer build upstream-format --new-format 28

   .. note::

      You specify the :command:`--new-format` to indicate the format (28) to which you transition.

#. Your mix is now synchronized with the new format (28); however, you must
   still advance to the desired or latest version.

   .. code-block:: bash

      mixer versions update --upstream-version 30700

Advanced
--------

To properly remove a bundle from being tracked by :command:`swupd`,
do a manual format bump. This process can also be used to perform
customizations during the update, such as:

* Adjustment in the command parameters

* Change the content of the chroot

Use the `afb.sh reference script`_ to learn how to do a manual format bump.
The :file:`afb.sh` script shows an example of how to:

* Create a mix

* Add a bundle

* Deprecate a bundle

* Do a format bump to remove the deprecated bundle

Read the comments above each line for an explanation of each step as you
execute commands. Use this same process on your mix if you need to remove a
bundle and its tracking.

Format version
--------------

Compatible versions of an OS are tracked with an OS *compatibility epoch*.
Versions of an OS within an epoch are fully compatible and can update to any
other version within that epoch. The compatibility epoch is set as the
`Format` variable in the :file:`mixer.state` file. Variables in the
:file:`mixer.state` are used by mixer between executions and should not be
manually changed.

Format bump
-----------

Mixer needs to produce content that is consumable by swupd. For swupd to
consume the content, it needs a consistent protocol that describes the
requirements of the Manifest.

If the `Format` increments to a new epoch (a "format bump"),  the underlying
`swupd` protocol has changed such that updating from one build version in an
old format to a new build version in a new format is **only** allowed if one
performs a corresponding format bump.

Format bumps are “checkpoints” (see Figure 1). The first release (20) is
built on the previous format with a `swupd` that is capable of interpreting
the next format. The second release (30) has the same content, but it’s
built in the new format.

Suppose you have build version 10, but you need the tools in build version
40. Whereas version 10 belongs to Format 27, version 40 belongs to Format
28. The swupd client needs to follow formats sequentially. First, you must
update to version 20, which effectively enables a format bump to version 30.
Doing a format bump bridges the gap so your mix can progress to build
version 40.

.. figure:: ../../_figures/mixer/format-bump.png
   :alt: Format bump

   Figure 1: Format bump

.. note::
   if you update to build 20 and then check which format of the distro is
   used, the new build version will show 30, and the new format will show 28.

Bundles
=======

mixer stores information about the bundles included in a mix in a flat file
called :file:`mixbundles`, which is located in the path set by the VERSIONS_PATH variable in :file:`builder.conf`. :file:`mixbundles` is automatically created when the mix is initiated. mixer will refresh the file each time you change the bundles in the mix.

Bundles can include other bundles. Nested bundles can themselves include
other bundles. If you see an unexpected bundle in your mix, it is likely a
nested bundle in one of the bundles you explicitly added.

A bundle will fill into one of two categories: upstream or local. Upstream
bundles are those provided by |CL|. Local bundles are either modified upstream bundles or new local bundles.

Upstream bundles
----------------

mixer automatically downloads and caches upstream bundle definition files.
These definition files are stored in the upstream-bundles directory in the
workspace. Do not modify the files in this directory. This directory is
simply a mirror for mixer to use. mixer will automatically delete the
contents of this directory before repopulating it on-the-fly if a new
version must be downloaded.

The mixer tool automatically caches the bundles for the |CL| version
configured in the :file:`upstreamversion` file. mixer also cleans up old
versions once they are no longer needed.

Local bundles
-------------

Local bundles are bundles that you create, or are edited versions of upstream
bundles. Local bundle definition files are stored in the local-bundles
directory in the workspace. The LOCAL_BUNDLE_DIR variable sets the path of this directory in the :file:`builder.conf` file.

*mixer always checks for local bundles first and the upstream bundles
second.* So bundles in the local-bundles directory will always take
precedence over any upstream bundles that have the same name. This
precedence enables you to copy upstream bundles locally, and edit into a
local variation.

Bundle configuration
--------------------

mixer provides commands to configure the bundles for a mix, such as to add a
bundle to a mix, to create a new bundle for a mix, or to remove a bundle from a
mix. View the `mixer.bundle man page`_ for a full list of commands and more
information on configuring bundles in a mix.

Editing an existing local bundle is as simple as opening the bundle definition
file in your favorite editor, making the desired edits, and saving your changes.

.. note::

   Removing bundles from a mix: By default, removing a bundle will only
   remove the bundle from the mix. The local bundle definition file will
   still remain. To completely remove a bundle, including its local bundle definition file, use the :command:`--local` flag.

   If you remove the bundle definition file for a local, edited version of an
   upstream bundle in a mix, the mix reverts to reference the original upstream version of the bundle.

Configure and enable Docker
===========================

Use these steps to enable Docker for the mixer tool. Make sure to
`Configure Docker proxy info`_ first if needed.

#. Start the Docker daemon:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo systemctl start docker
      sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock
      sudo docker info

#. Add user to the docker group

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo usermod -G docker -a <username>

Pull Docker container manually (optional)
-----------------------------------------

By default, mixer automatically pulls a Docker container for mixing if one
does not already exist. If you need to troubleshoot the mixer container, it
may be useful to manually pull a mixer Docker container.

Versions of the mixer Docker container are available under the tags for the
`clearlinux/mixer repo <https://hub.docker.com/r/clearlinux/mixer/tags/>`_
on Docker Hub. Each version of the mixer Docker container is named after the
associated |CL| upstream format version. Refer to `Format version`_ for
additional information on upstream format versions.

Use the following steps to manually pull a mixer Docker container:

#. Find the version of the container you need by viewing the tags for the
   `clearlinux/mixer repo <https://hub.docker.com/r/clearlinux/mixer/tags/>`_
   on Docker Hub.

#. Pull the latest container version:

   .. code-block:: bash

      docker pull clearlinux/mixer:<upstream-format-version>

#. View local docker images:

   .. code-block:: bash

      docker images

Configure Docker proxy info
===========================

If needed, use these steps to configure the Docker proxy information.

#. Create the Docker daemon proxy config directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d

#. Create :file:`/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf` and
   add the following using your own proxy values:

   .. code-block:: console

      [Service]
      Environment="HTTP_PROXY=<HTTP proxy URL>:<port number>"
      Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=<HTTPS proxy URL>:<port number>"

#. Reload the Docker daemon:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Configure the Docker container proxies, to pass proxy settings to
containers:

#. Create a directory for your container config:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mkdir ~/.docker

#. Create the config file :file:`~/.docker/config.json` and add the following
   entries, using your own proxy values:

   .. code-block:: console

      {
        "proxies":
        {
          "default":
          {
            "httpProxy": "<proxy-url>:<port>",
            "httpsProxy": "<proxy-url>:<port>"
          }
        }
      }

#. Set ownership and permission on the docker config directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo chown "$USER":"$USER" /home/"$USER"/.docker -R
      sudo chmod g+rwx "$HOME/.docker" -R

Configure proxies to allow mixer to access upstream content from behind
a firewall.

#. Open your :file:`$HOME/.bashrc` file and add proxy and port values for the
   following:

   .. code-block:: console

      export http_proxy="<proxy-url>:<port>"
      export https_proxy="<proxy-url>:<port>"
      export HTTP_PROXY="<proxy-url>:<port>"
      export HTTPS_PROXY="<proxy-url>:<port>"
      export no_proxy="<...>"

#. Log out and log back in for the proxies to take effect.

Set up a nginx web server for mixer
===================================

A web server is needed to host your update content. In this example, we use
the nginx web server, which comes with |CL|.

Set up a nginx web server for mixer with the following steps:

#. Install the :command:`nginx` bundle:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo swupd bundle-add nginx

#. Make the directory where mixer updates will reside:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo mkdir -p /var/www

#. Create a symbolic link between your workspace updates and the updates on
   the local nginx web server. In this example, `$HOME/mixer` is the
   workspace for the mix.

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo ln -sf $HOME/mixer/update/www /var/www/mixer

#. Set up ``nginx`` configuration:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo mkdir -p  /etc/nginx/conf.d

#. Copy the default example configuration file:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo cp -f /usr/share/nginx/conf/nginx.conf.example /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

#. Configure the mixer update server. Create and add the following server
   configuration content to :file:`/etc/nginx/conf.d/mixer.conf` (sudo required):

   .. code-block:: console

      server {
           server_name localhost;
           location / {
                     root /var/www/mixer;
                     autoindex on;
           }
      }

#. Restart the daemon, enable nginx on boot, and start the service.

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo systemctl daemon-reload

      sudo systemctl enable nginx

      sudo systemctl start nginx

#. Verify the web server is running at \http://<ip-address>,
   where <ip-address> is the same one that you captured in
   `Example 1: Mix set up`_.
